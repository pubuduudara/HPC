My name is Pubudu Premathilake. Being an undergraduate from the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Peradeniya, I currently work as an intern in the Hardware Acceleration division. I am interested in competitive programming and high-performance computing. Apart from these academic interests, I am also interested in photography, hiking, and traveling. I was inspired to join LSEG because I wanted to gain work experience at a well-reputed global company where I can apply the academic knowledge and skills I have developed as an undergraduate.
